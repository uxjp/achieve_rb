# Achieve JS

This project is all about creating examples that help you and me become proficient Ruby developers at a basic level. I will aim to use the minimum amount of code necessary to achieve some fundamental goals, as recommended by trusted software engineers.  

## Some steps to follow towards mastering **Ruby**

- Make a CRUD in Ruby
- Make a Ruby CLI
- Learn to create a Ruby package
- Learn to consume a Ruby package
- Learn to configure and update packages
- Learn to deploy Ruby
- Learn to consume requests using Ruby
- Learn to use databases in Ruby
- Learn to handle files in Ruby  

There are many winding paths to navigate in order to complete this journey. For example, you can use Rails, Sinatra, or even Hanami to traverse some of these paths.  

You will learn the details of the language as you deal with these things.
